# Everything will be dockerised

# How to install

## Unix based Systems (Mac, Linux, BSD, ...)

### Build Requirements
You will need docker, docker-compose and docker-buildx. Names of packages can vary across Distros and OS's.

```bash
git clone https://gitea.hopeless-cloud.xyz/Coinflow/coinflow.git
cd coinflow
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Windows

```bash
git clone https://gitea.hopeless-cloud.xyz/Coinflow/coinflow.git
```
Figure out the rest yourself. Some possibilities include using Docker Desktop, cmd or even WSL.
